## Service API and pricing
This program uses the WaboxApp API for sending messages and getting status information about the linked phone. In order to use WhatsMore, you'll need to create an API token by first opening a free account here https://www.waboxapp.com and following the setup process there to link your phone. You are automatically allowed to send 100 free messages each month. The service takes a pay as you go approach, so if you need more messages, you will automatically pay based on the amount of messages you send. Current prices can be found here https://www.waboxapp.com/pricing on their site.
