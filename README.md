# WhatsMore
This program enables you to send messages to multiple WhatsApp accounts using your computer. I created WhatsMore to replace a script that a friend was using to do the same because it had some problematic limitations. Unlike other social platforms, WhatsApp still doesn't have an API that lets you send messages to users. They do have a Chat API, but this API only starts a conversation in a browser and is a lot like the 'mailto' protocol for email. As a result, we are left seeking alternative approaches while we wait for WhatsApp to catch up. As for the usefulness of WhatsMore, it will depend on your needs. In the case of my friend, he uses it as part of his business to send reminders to his clients regarding a particular job performed since he found they respond sooner this way than over email.

## API Service and pricing
This program uses the WaboxApp API for sending messages and getting status information about the linked phone. To use WhatsMore, you'll need to create an API token by first opening a free account here https://www.waboxapp.com and following the setup process there to link your phone. You are automatically allowed to send 100 free messages each month. The API service takes a pay as you go approach for payment, so you will be charged based on the number of messages you send, and only if you go over those 100 free messages each month. Current prices can be found here https://www.waboxapp.com/pricing on the WaboxApp website.
